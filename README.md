- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: Classify data points for more accurate predictions.  
- **Random Forests**: Improve accuracy by combining multiple decision trees for robust results.
  
These algorithms are implemented using **scikit-learn** and trained in **Jupyter Notebooks** for the best performance. 

### 💻 **Tech Stack**
- **React Native (Expo)** 📱: For mobile app development.  
- **Flask**: Python server for handling API requests and processing predictions.
